Bug-tracker-v0.1
This web app makes myself for practise. You may use it as you want.
App includes [Apollo GraphQL Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) components, but no frontend implementation.
